Return type of printf
    Returns no. of characters i.e int.
Return type of scanf
Parameters that can be passed in switch case
Difference b/w for, while and do while. 
    For and while - entry control
        For is used when no. of iterations is given and while when not given.
    Do while - exit control
Types of relational operators
    6 : >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=
Difference b/w logical and bitwie operators
    Logical operator has boolean return type 
    Bitwise operator has


system.out.println : system is the class, out is the object, println is the method
Function and method: Method is a function written inside a class.

Q) x=~5   -6 (increase by 1 and change sign)
    ~10   -11
    ~99   -100
    ~(-5)   4 (decrease by 1 and change sign)

5>>1 (Right shift) [value / 2 ^ no. of bits]
    2
5>>2
    1

5<<1 (Left shift) [value * 2 ^ no. of bits]
    10

Binary conversion:
    67:
        128  64  32  16  8  4  2  1
             1    0   0  0  0  1  1


Operators:
    Division Operator (/)
        Depends on sign of both Nominator and  Denominator
        5/2 = 2 [int/int = int]
        5.0/2 = 2.5
        5/2.0 = 2.5
        5.0/5.0 = 2.5

        6/-5 = -1
        -6/5 = -1
        -6/-5 = 1

    Mod operator (%)
        Always depend on sign of Nominator
        6%5   1
        -6%5 -1
        6%-5  1
        -6%-5 -1

    (=)
    We cannot use multiple variables on LHS
        d=c+2=b+1=a [Cant e compiled]

        d=2>3>1
            1>1
             0

        d=a<b<c-1
            0

a = 012 [Octal]
b = 0x12 [Hexadecimal]

Octal to decimal conversion
    a = 012 [*8^0,1,...]

!10 = 0
~10 = -11

*)printf("%d", (10++)) = Error [Constant value cannot be incremented]

var=- -10  => 10
var=+ +10  => 10

sizeof() is an operator in C.
    if we dont define typeof float, by default double(8)
    sizeof(125.50) = 8
    int = float = 4
    sizeof(65) = 4
    short int i = 4;
    char j = 'A'
        sizeof(i+j)= 4 (Cuz int cannot be converted into short bt short can be converted into int!)

Difference b/t short and short int:
    Is short primitive- No, short is not a type of data.

-100; -> will not cause error anywhere in code [Constant and ;].

Switch case:
    Cases cannot be duplicate.
    Expressions allowed
    Only int and char allowed for cases and switch Expressions
    Default can be anywhere but wil be evaluated at last
    Logical operators not used in cases(&&, ||, !, ^) 

*In for loop we can have multipal variables and conditions but it depends on last one due to comma operator which retorns the last value.

*m=5
int x = printf("%d ",m);
printf(x);
    5 3
printf("%d"); 
    Garbage values
printf("%d",a,b) [No error]

char s[]="he",t[]="he"
    but s!=t [Becoz array name contains the adress of first element of array].


There are 3 ways to write C++ code:
    Procedural

    Object based
        int main(){
            code
        }

    *Object oriented based [We will study this]
        class A{

        }
        int main()
        {

        }
   
cout is an object of ostream class
    << is insertion operator & is used with cout

cin is an object of istream class
    << is extraction operator

class is a container that contains variables and methods
 
Modifiers
    Public, private 
    By default private

Encapsulation : Binding of data in single unit

use getline() to get content after space.
c.ignore() to remove defauilt next line char.[when calling string after integer]
